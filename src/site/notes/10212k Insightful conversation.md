## Two principles

* The Insight Hub should directly the creation of  __business decisions__
* and where it can't then at least inspire purposeful conversation.



### So what is a Business decisions - 
A simple understanding

Or to put it another way an insightful idea requires the purposeful engagement of stakeholders for success as business decisions.

### Initiative
An idea that is aiming to become an engagement  project

### Stakeholders 
can be both internal to UKPN  or external. They could be named individuals within organisations , they could also be 'stakeholder segments' for example customers with specific energy requirements with whom it is not practical to speak to directly but instead will need to be engaged with by using support groups , charities or other 3rd sector groups. Finally there may have been specific people who were engaged with in their role as spokespersons for specific segment, but who are no longer working at those organisations - in this case it may be necessary to do some detective work  to find another suitable stakeholder contact.

### Insight
Some document research, analysis or other useful information. Insight will typically relate to stakeholders 

### Engagement

Is an initiative that has sufficient insight to support engaging purposefully with stakeholders

### How can search help with this

In the simplest terms by allowing UKPN staff to find  information that would help them achieve.

## A more interesting picture
>Because problems are general but solutions are specific

Given a problem expressed as :

#### TRIZ in a nutshell

__Optimise for parameter A while maintaining parameter B what peculiar situation provides a solution__

This is a site that allows you to explore TRIZ parameters in a design and engineering context
[[https://triz.surge.sh\|https://triz.surge.sh]]


### Example 1
A parametrised statement  : you want to optimise for speed but the car must maintain its stability through sharp turns. 
Solution : F1 the car only needs to stay together for the duration of the race. 

### Example 2
You want to install more EV charging points while not incurring excessive cost. 
Solution : install the EV charging points in lamp posts as this removes the need for expensive planning .

In short find worlds in which the problem isn't a problem. 

### Worlds?
In true TRIZ there is something between parameters and solutions , dimensions , but we've simplified things down to just say world 

## Now imagine

If search helped you search for insights either by parameters that your problem shares or for solutions that you can apply to your problem. 

### What about AI
could help express initiatives in parameter form and also suggest solutions, the beauty of TRIZ is that it makes writing prompts that get interesting answers that much easier.
